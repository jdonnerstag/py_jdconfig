This is a test of the python Hydra package.

Topics of interest:
- how to config for different environments such as dev, test, pre-prod, prod
- during dev, I may require quickly changing configs. How to? May be I don't
  want to check them in. I definitely don't want to leave the impression, that
  this is part of a CR/feature.
